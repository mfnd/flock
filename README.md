## Flock

Flock (`flock-ui`) is an app to make computers in the local network sleep or wake up from sleep remotely. It requires and utilizes Wake-on-LAN (WoL) support on computers for waking them up. `flockd` (Flock Daemon) should be installed on computers for device discovery and enabling remote sleep.
